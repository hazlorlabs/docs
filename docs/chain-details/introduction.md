# Introduction




### Hazlor Chain

Hazlor introduces the Hazlor mainnet beta, the Cosmos SDK based EVM compatible chain, COMING IN  2022.



#### Hazlor on Ethermint

Hazlor is powered by [Ethermint](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint), which allows rapid porting of apps & smart contracts from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Hazlor base settlement currency will be CRO, the native currency of the Hazlor Chain.
The Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol enables interoperability and bridging to the Hazlor Chain: a fully decentralised, open-source, energy efficient public chain with high speed and extremely low fees. It also allows interoperating with other IBC-enabled chains (e.g., Cosmos Hub).

### Features

**EVM Compatible** - Ethereum developers are used to smart contract capabilities as Ethermint can support any smart contracts, DAOs or Dapps deployed on Ethereum.

**Scalable** - Tendermint can process way more transactions per minute than the EVM, making it faster, cheaper and greener to execute smart contracts.

**Interoperable** - IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other; interoperate and transfer value, interchange assets and services, and connect without running into the scaling issues inherent in some of the largest blockchains today.

**Easy deployment** - Users can follow the deployment instruction to quickly and easily deploy Hazlor network for their own using purposes.

**Hazlor.finance ecosystem** - 10 million users + ecosystem

**Hazlor.finance community Support** - Finance + Audit
